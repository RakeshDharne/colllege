# Step 1: Create a test directory and file on host
mkdir test_mount
cd test_mount
echo "This is a test file from host" > test.txt

# Step 2: Run Ubuntu container with mounted directory
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/data ubuntu:latest bash

# Inside the container, you can now:
ls /data                  # See the mounted directory
cat /data/test.txt       # Read existing file
echo "Created inside container" > /data/container.txt    # Create new file
exit                     # Exit container

# Step 3: Verify on host
ls                       # Will show both test.txt and container.txt
cat container.txt        # Read file created from container
